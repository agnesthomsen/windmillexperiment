%AGNES: PLEASE CHECK THIS STUFF OUT AT THE BOTTOM FOR AN EXPLANATION

%Anything that appears after a '%' is called a 'comment', that means that it will not appear in the PDF version of the document
%Below I have some code that you can copy and paste into your report when you need to:

%EQUATIONS
%This equation has all of the symbols you are likely to use in it, if you need a symbol that isn't written here, ask me or draw it in http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html
%\begin{equation}
%1 + 2 \times 3 \div 4 = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5^{1} 
%\label{WRITE A UNIQUE NAME HERE}
%\end{equation}

%FIGURES
%This will put a figure in the text, the figure doesn't necessarily appear exactly where you will expect it to, but don't worry about that for now.
%Replace the Graph.pdf with your own figure name. Ideally the figures should all be PDF files, but some other image formats also work.
%The figures also have to be in the same folder as the .tex file.
%You can make the picture bigger or smaller by changing the number 0.7 - The maximum size this should be is 1, the smallest size is 0
%\begin{figure}
%  \centering
%  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/Graph.pdf}
%  \caption{WRITE YOUR CAPTION FOR THE FIGURE HERE}
%  \label{WRITE A UNIQUE NAME HERE}
%\end{figure}

%REFERENCING EQUATIONS AND FIGURES
%If you want to refer to a particular equation or figure in the text, you should write:
%See Figure \ref{UNIQUE NAME HERE THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE NAME IN THE \label{...} OF THE EQUATION OR FIGURE}

%BIBLIOGRAPHY
%If you want to put a reference to the bibliography, you should write:
%...as explained by Albert Einstein \cite{UNIQUE NAME OF REFERENCE}.

%ADDING TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHY LIST
%This is done in the file references.bib, where a full example is given
